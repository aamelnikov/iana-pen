Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are a technical protocol parameter frequently used
for network management, and in protocols such as
LDAP, DIAMETER or GSS-API.  This document 
discusses what a PEN is, common uses for PENs, and
IANA's registration procedures PENs.  The registration 
procedures include instructions and requirements for obtaining a new
PEN, modifying existing registrations, and the
removal of existing registrations.
</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

  <t>
    A Private Enterprise Number (also known as a "PEN"), is a non-negative integer, unique within
    the iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise (1.3.6.1.4.1) Object Identifiers (OIDs<!--////Alexey: add reference for OIDs-->) subtree
    of the ISO Object Identifier (OID) hierarchy. This hierarchy, jointly developed by ITU-T
    and ISO/IEC was developed to name "any type of object, concept or 'thing' with a globaly unambiguous name
    which requires a persistent name" (See http://www.oid-info.com/#oid).
    The sub-tree for which the IETF is the Registration Authority, originally defined in <xref target="RFC1065"/>,
    is used to allow any entity to obtain a globally unique identifier to reference
    an organization ("enterprise") in <!--IETF-defined--> protocols.
<!--
    The iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise OID is known as the Private
    Enterprise Number OID.
-->
<!--From RFC 2578:
      The private(4) subtree is used to identify objects defined
      unilaterally.  The enterprises(1) subtree beneath private is used,
      among other things, to permit providers of networking subsystems to
      register models of their products.
-->
  </t>

  <t>To date, the procedures for the assignment of new PENs and
     the modification of assigned PENs have not been clearly documented.  
	   Private Enterprise Numbers are referenced in RFCs  <xref target="RFC1157"/> <xref target="RFC1213"/>
	   and <xref target="RFC2578"/>.
	   These documents primarily define Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), 
	   Management Information Base (MIB) and Structure of Management Information (SMI) structures.
	   As such, none of these RFCs clearly describe PENs nor do they define PEN registration procedures.
	</t>

	<t>
    As a result of the lack of documented process, updates to assigned PENs can be challenging.

    Given there are no clear registration requirements, it can be difficult to
    validate change requests, particularly in cases
    such as updates to organization names or legal ownership, changes to
    email addresses of the registered PEN owner, etc.
  </t>

	<t>
	   This document introduces PENs, how they are commonly used, and
     their registration and update procedures.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Introduction to Private Enterprise Numbers">
      
	<t>
    PENs are frequently embedded in OIDs (Object Identifiers) <!--////Alexey: add reference for OIDs-->,
    which are most often used in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
    Management Information Base (MIB) configurations.
    However, PENs are not designed to be used exclusively for SNMP purposes,
    but rather they can be and are used by a variety
    protocols and Data Manipulation Languages.
    There is no restriction for using private enterprise numbers for other protocols
    or data models than SNMP or MIB.</t>

  <t>
    If the OID is only to be used privately, then enterprise numbers are to be used.
    PEN is a number under the prefix 1.3.6.1.4.1. and PEN appears as follows:
    
      <list>
        <t>
          Prefix: iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.(Your node)<vspace/>
          1.3.6.1.4.1.xxxx
        </t>
      </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    IANA only manages and maintain this hierarchy tree under the IESG guidelines.
    There are many other prefixes, such as 2.16.840.1113883, 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.21,
    etc., under completely different arcs and managed by other repositories (which might or
    might not be managed by IANA).
    This document doesn't cover management of these other repositories.
  </t>

<!--Alexey: not sure about this
  <t>OID-info.com has detailed resources on OIDs  See: http://oid-info.com/faq.htm#3.</t>
-->
      
	  <section anchor="others" title="Various uses of PENs &quot;in the wild&quot;">
		<t>As some examples documented on Wikipedia, the most common OIDs seen "in the wild"
		usually belong to the private enterprise numbers allocated by IANA under the 1.3.6.1.4.1
		(iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise) tree. Increasingly, an OID with health
        care and public health informatics in the United States is being used. Health Level Seven (HL7),
        a standards-developing organization in the area of electronic health care data exchange is an
        assigning authority at the 2.16.840.1.113883 (joint-iso-itu-t.country.us.organization.hl7) tree.
		</t>
		<t>It is important to note that despite the name PENs do not necessarily represent a manufacturer or Vendor ID.
    For example they can represent organizations and even independent developers.
		</t>
   
		<t>	
			The registrant of a Private Enterprise Number can create sub-trees by appending a "." along
            with unique numbers at the end of their PEN, i.e. to perform its own sub-allocations. For example,
            for LDAP, the registrant of PEN &lt;PEN&gt; can use:</t>
			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.1 for LDAP Object Classes</t>
			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.2 for LDAP attribute types</t>
			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.3 for LDAP syntaxes</t>

			<t>A particular Object class can have OID:</t>

			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.1.100</t>
			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.1.200 for subsidiaries an/or divisions</t>

			<t>In general any number of additional levels are permitted, for example:</t>

			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.1.1 can be used as a parent OID for all email related object classes, and</t>

			<t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.1.2 can be used for web related object classes.</t>

      <t>iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.&lt;PEN&gt;.1.3 can be used for instant messaging related object classes, etc.</t>

    <t>Below are more example uses of PENs:

      <list>
        <t> Distinguished Names and other components in X.509 certificates; </t>
        <t> Various schema elements in X.500/LDAP directories;</t>
        <t> GSS-API</t>
        <t> extensions to DIAMETER</t>
        <t> PA-TNC <xref target="RFC5792"/> and PB-TNC <xref target="RFC5793"/></t>
      </list>

    </t>

    <t>
      Important to note that how the numbers are used is up to the various implementers and
      companies building products. Neither ICANN or the IETF can police how people use the numbers
      out in the wild. The parties in question should resolve any inappropriate usage among themselves,
      and ICANN and the IETF have no role in such disputes.
    </t>

  <section title="PEN Assignment">

    <t>
    Assignments of PENs are done by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
    This section provides information relating to the assignment of new PENs and
    the requirements associated with updating already assigned PENs.
    </t>

    <section anchor="new-assignment" title="Assignment of a New PEN">

      <t>
        PENs are assigned through a "First Come First Served" registration policy as described in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
        They are assigned sequentially.   There is no opportunity to request a particular private enterprise number.
      </t>

      <t>
        A PEN can be requested by individuals or organizations in order to obtain a unique value for their
        "enterprise". Requests for new PENs can be submitted via an automated form at IANA.
      </t>

      <t>
        In order to facilitate appropriate registration, and in particular, subsequent update of an assigned PEN,
        a small amount of information is required. This information includes
        the name and contact information of the requesting organization (or individual),
        the name of the contact person for the PEN, and an e-mail address of the contact.
      </t>

      <t>
        <!--/////Alexey: open issue, need more text to discourage that-->
        Historically, users submit a program name, product, project, and random abbreviation as
        the organization name to when applying for a PEN.  This practice is discouraged
        since multiple programs, product, and/or projects can have their own sub-trees under the PEN assigned
        to the organization (or individual), thus there is rarely a need for an organization
        to have multiple IANA-assigned PENs.
      </t>

      <t>Before requesting additional OIDs, IANA encourages the identification of any existing
      OID assignment(s) to the requesting organization (or individual) and the creation of sub-trees
      where possible and appropriate. IANA may decline the allocation of new PENs to organizations
      that have existing registrations unless justification for multiple allocations is provided.</t>

    <t>The following information will be requested for a new registration:</t>
    
		<t> Registrant (Company/Organization) Name (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Registrant Postal Address (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Contact Name (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Contact E-mail Address (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Contact Postal Address (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t> Contact Phone Number (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t> Reference (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t> Comments (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t>
			Registrant (Company/Organization) Name: The name of 
			the organization or individual responsible for the registration 
			of Private Enterprise Number.  If the organization is a company, 
			it should be the full legal name including "Inc.", "Ltd.", etc.
            The registrant name can contain non-ASCII characters, but IANA might limit the characters allowed.
		</t>

		<t>
      Registrant Postal Address: The postal address/location of
      the organization/individual requesting the PEN.
      This information is only used by IANA for verification and will be kept private.
    </t>
		<t>
      Contact Name: Name of the individual who will be
      responsible for the PEN on behalf of the company.
      This Contact person is authorized to submit changes on behalf of
      the Registrant (Company/Organization) described above.
      The contact name can contain non-ASCII characters, but IANA might limit the characters allowed.
    </t>
        
		<t>
			Contact E-Mail Address: The e-mail address of the individual 
			responsible for the PEN.  The e-mail address must be one the Contact
			person can email confirmation from.  This e-mail address will be 
			publicly available in the IANA PEN Registry.  The Contact E-mail 
			Address can be the same one as the Registrant's E-mail address. 
		</t>

		<t>
			Contact Postal Address: The full postal address of the individual 
			responsible the PEN, including state/province, zip/postal code, 
			country, etc.  
		</t>
		<t>
			Contact Phone: The telephone number (with extension where appropriate) 
			of the individual responsible for the PEN, including country code.
		</t>
    <t>
    		Reference: A document associated with the implementation of the OID 
    		can be referenced with the registration.  
    </t>
    <t>Comments: This field will contain the old Registrant/Company Name associated with a PEN if applicable.</t>
        
		<t>It is recommended that a single PEN is granted per organization.  IANA 
			does not expect to allocate additional PENs to the same Registrants 
			(Companies/Organizations) that have existing PEN records listed 
			in the IANA PEN registry.</t>
        
    </section>
      
    <section anchor="update" title="Update of an Assigned PEN">
    		
		<t>When a Company/Organization has been merged or acquired by another enterprise, 
		the Registrant (Company/Organization) Name can be annotated in the registry.
    IANA will verify the requested changes, and, if it deems to be
    necessary, official letters from the existing owner might be required.
    It is not guarantee that the request will be granted if
    IANA does not have sufficient information to verify the changes, or
    if there is legacy use of the PEN out in the wild.
    </t>

		<t>All information associated with existing PEN records, excluding the Registrant (Company/Organization) Name, 
			shall be updated if the information is obsoleted.  (See the preceding section to update the Registrant 
			(Company/Organization) Name.)  A request to update Contact information associated with an existing PEN 
			record shall be submitted via an automated form at IANA.  Requests can only be fulfilled upon 
			verification by IANA and/or subject matter experts.  Additional documentations will be required if it 
			deems to be necessary to validate the request.</t>
		
		<t>A change to the Contact Name of existing PEN records can be made to IANA in case of personnel changes, 
			change of employment, acquisitions, etc.  It would be ideal that new requests shall be completed by 
			the existing Contacts for the PEN records.  E-mail verifications of the requested changes are required.  
			Alternatively, supplemental documentations and/or letters issued by the Company/Organization (Registrant 
			Name) will be required if E-mail verifications cannot be fulfilled and if it deems to be necessary. </t>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="Removals" title="Removals of Private Enterprise Numbers">
    			
    <t>Such request does not happen often and regularly.</t>

		<t>Considering the fact that there might be legacy uses of any existing allocation, registrations SHOULD NOT 
			be removed.</t>
			
		<t>A Contact Name can request to remove the corresponding Contact information if the company is no longer
		in operation, the Contact does not wish to be listed in the IANA PEN registry and
		if the PEN is no longer believed to be in use.  The Modification 
		procedure described above SHOULD be followed.</t>
		
		
		<t>Requests can only be fulfilled upon verification by IANA and/or 
			subject matter experts if it deems to be necessary.
		</t>

    	<t>IF the removal request is honoured, the entry is marked as "Unassigned"
<!--////Alexey: some of the entries in the registry are actually marked as "Reserved".
        Are these errors in the registry?-->      
	   and annotated as "returned on yyyy-mm-dd by xxxxxxx".

        See the Security Considerations section in BCP 26 <xref target="RFC5226"/>,
        and note that improper definition and application of IANA registration policies
        can introduce both interoperability and security issues.
        It is critical that registration policies be considered carefully and separately
        for each registry.
        Overly restrictive policies can result in the lack of registration of
        code points and parameters that need to be registered, while overly permissive
        policies can result in inappropriate registrations.
        Striking the right balance is an important part of document development.
      </t>

      <t>
        As mentioned in a preceding section, given there are no clear registration requirements
        in the past, only limited information is recorded, significant out-of-date information
        is listed in the registry, and there is no strong authentication mechanism in place,
        the implications (if any) of the theft of PENs is possible.  There is a possibility
        that the registration data can be transferred to someone else unintentionally.
