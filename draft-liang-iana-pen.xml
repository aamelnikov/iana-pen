Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are a technical protocol parameter frequently used
for network management, and in protocols such as
LDAP, DIAMETER or GSS-API.  This document 
discusses what a PEN is, common uses for PENs, and
IANA's registration procedures PENs.  The registration 
procedures include instructions and requirements for obtaining a new
PEN, modifying existing registrations, and the
removal of existing registrations.
</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">

  <t>
    A Private Enterprise Number (also known as a "PEN"), is a non-negative integer, unique within
    the ISO Object Identifier (OID) hierarchy. The full OID hierarchy was jointly developed by ITU-T
    and ISO/IEC to allow the assignment of globaly unambiguous numeric names.
    (The original document describing the OID hierarchy has been withdrawn by ITU-T, but some
    current description can be found in the ITU-T X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series.)
    The basic idea behind OIDs is that
    each level of the hierarchy could have its own registration process for names in that level.
    PENs are a set of numbers in a subtree of the OIDs tree.
  </t>

  <t>
    The PEN sub-tree for which the IETF is the Registration Authority, originally defined sometime before 1990,
    is used to allow any entity to obtain a globally unique identifier to reference
    an organization ("enterprise"), often in protocols. IANA is now the Registration Authority.
    The location of the PEN subtree in the OID
    hierarchy is 1.3.6.1.4.1, which is also known as "iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise".
    IANA manages and maintains this hierarchy tree under guidelines from the IETF.
  </t>

  <t>
     Many standards, both from the IETF and other organizations, use PENs as identifiers. These standards
     sometimes use just the PEN (the single integer assigned by IANA, such as "42"), or sometimes use
     the entire OID including the PEN (such as "1.3.6.1.4.1.42").
  </t>

  <t>To date, the procedures for the assignment of PENs have not been clearly documented. RFCs from the
     early 1990s talk about the use of PENs, but not how they are assigned. This document fixes that
     problem by defining the procedures IANA uses to assign PENs.
	</t>

	<t>
    As a result of the lack of documented process, updates to assigned PENs can be challenging.
    Given there are no clear registration requirements, it can be difficult to
    validate change requests, particularly in cases
    such as updates to organization names or legal ownership, changes to
    email addresses of the registered PEN owner, and so on.
  </t>

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

    </section>

	  <section anchor="others" title="Various Uses of PENs &quot;in the wild&quot;">

<t>
PENs as integers are used in many ways. In IETF protocols, they are often used in extension
mechanisms to cause an extension to have a unique identifier.
Examples of protocols that use PEN values in their extension mechanisms include
RADIUS <xref target="RFC2865"/>,
DIAMETER <xref target="RFC3588"/>,
Syslog <xref target="RFC5424"/>,
RSVP <xref target="RFC5284"/>,
PA-TNC <xref target="RFC5792"/>,
PB-TNC <xref target="RFC5793"/>,
and vCard <xref target="RFC6350"/>.
</t>

<t>
PENs in OIDs are often used in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Management Information Base (MIB) configurations.
PENs as part of an OID are also used in protocols for extension identification, although generally only in protocols that
already use OIDs as identifiers. For examle, extensions in PKIX <xref target="RFC5280"/> are given as OIDs,
so private extensions that use PENs would use the full OID.
</t>

<t>
The places that PENs are used is completely up to implementers. Neither IANA nor the IETF police how
people use the numbers out in the wild, nor do they have any say in disputes about how any
particular PEN might or might not be used.
</t>
      
  </section>

  <section title="PEN Assignment">

    <t>
    Assignments of PENs are done by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
    This section provides information relating to the assignment of new PENs and
    the requirements associated with updating already-assigned PENs.
    </t>

    <section anchor="new-assignment" title="Assignment of a New PEN">

      <t>
        PENs are assigned through a "First Come First Served" registration policy as described in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
        They are assigned sequentially.
        There is no opportunity to request a particular private enterprise number.
      </t>

      <t>
        A PEN can be requested by individuals or organizations in order to obtain a unique value for their
        "enterprise". Requests for new PENs can be submitted via an automated form at IANA.
      </t>

      <t>
        In order to facilitate appropriate registration, and in particular, subsequent update of an assigned PEN,
        a small amount of information is required. This information includes
        the name and contact information of the requesting organization (or individual),
        the name of the contact person for the PEN, and an e-mail address of the contact.
      </t>

      <t>IANA encourages the identification of any existing
      OID assignment(s) to the requesting organization or individual and the creation of sub-trees
      where possible and appropriate.
      This should be done by a requester before applying for a new PEN.
      IANA may decline the allocation of new PENs to organizations
      that have existing registrations unless justification for multiple allocations is provided.</t>

    <t>The following information will be requested for a new registration:</t>

<t>*** Pearl: This list does not match the fields at http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page ***
</t>
    
		<t> Registrant (Company/Organization) Name (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Registrant Postal Address (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Contact Name (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Contact E-mail Address (REQUIRED)</t>
		<t> Contact Postal Address (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t> Contact Phone Number (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t> Reference (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t> Comments (OPTIONAL)</t>
		<t>
			Registrant (Company/Organization) Name: The name of 
			the organization or individual responsible for the registration 
			of Private Enterprise Number.
            The registrant name can contain any character allowed by IDNA <xref target="RFC5892"/>.
		</t>

		<t>
      Registrant Postal Address: The postal address/location of
      the organization/individual requesting the PEN.
      This information is only used by IANA for verification and will be kept private.
    </t>
		<t>
      Contact Name: Name of the individual who will be
      responsible for the PEN on behalf of the company.
      This Contact person is authorized to submit changes on behalf of
      the Registrant (Company/Organization) described above.
      The contact name can contain any character allowed by IDNA <xref target="RFC5892"/>.
    </t>
        
		<t>
			Contact E-Mail Address: The e-mail address of the individual 
			responsible for the PEN.  The e-mail address must be one the Contact
			person can email confirmation from.  This e-mail address will be 
			publicly available in the IANA PEN Registry.  The Contact E-mail 
			Address can be the same one as the Registrant's E-mail address. 
		</t>

		<t>
			Contact Postal Address: The full postal address of the individual 
			responsible the PEN, including state/province, zip/postal code, 
			country, etc.  
		</t>
		<t>
			Contact Phone: The telephone number (with extension where appropriate) 
			of the individual responsible for the PEN, including country code.
		</t>
        
    </section>
      
    <section anchor="update" title="Update of an Assigned PEN">
    		
		<t>If a registrant wants to change the organization or contact person, such as
           when a Company/Organization has been merged or acquired by another enterprise,
           the registrant can request that the assigned PEN registration be updated.
    IANA will verify the requested changes, and, if it deems to be
    necessary, official letters from the existing owner might be required.
    There is no guarantee that the request will be granted if
    IANA does not have sufficient information to verify the changes.
    </t>

		<t>A request to update Contact information associated with an existing PEN 
			record shall be submitted via an automated form at IANA.  Requests can only be fulfilled upon 
			verification by IANA and/or subject matter experts.  Additional documentations will be required if IANA 
			deems it to be necessary to validate the request.</t>
		
		<t>A change to the Contact Name of existing PEN records can be made to IANA in case of personnel changes, 
			change of employment, acquisitions, etc.  It would be ideal that new requests shall be completed by 
			the existing Contacts for the PEN records.  E-mail verifications of the requested changes are required.  
			Alternatively, supplemental documentations and/or letters issued by the Company/Organization (Registrant 
			Name) will be required if E-mail verifications cannot be fulfilled and if it deems to be necessary. </t>
 
<t>IANA SHOULD NOT remove entries from the PEN registry.</t>

          The range for PENs is 0 to 2**32-1. The values 0 and 4294967295 (2**32-1) are marked as Reserved.
          Note that while the original PEN definition had no upper bound, this document now defines the upper bound
          because some protocols limit how big PENs can be.
          For example, DIAMETER <xref target="RFC3588"/> specifies that PENs used in that protocol can be no bigger than 2**32-1,
          and other protocols limit PEN values to 2**24-1.

<t>
There is a PEN number, 32473, reserved for use as examples in documentation.
This reservation is described in <xref target="RFC5612"/>.

      <section anchor="Historic" title="Historical Assignments">
    		<t>This document will correct the missing historical assignments that 
    			predates ICANN's management of the existing registry.  These entries
          will be marked as "Reserved" and annotated as "Returned on yyyy-mm-dd" in the registry.
          These numbers MAY be re-assigned

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	  <t>
        See the Security Considerations section in BCP 26 <xref target="RFC5226"/>,
        and note that improper definition and application of IANA registration policies
        can introduce both interoperability and security issues.
        It is critical that registration policies be considered carefully and separately
        for each registry.
        Overly restrictive policies can result in the lack of registration of
        code points and parameters that need to be registered, while overly permissive
        policies can result in inappropriate registrations.
        Striking the right balance is an important part of document development.
      </t>

      <t>
        As mentioned in a preceding section, given there are no clear registration requirements
        in the past, only limited information is recorded, significant out-of-date information
        is listed in the registry, and there is no strong authentication mechanism in place,
        the implications (if any) of the theft of PENs is possible.  There is a possibility
        that the registration data can be transferred to someone else unintentionally.
